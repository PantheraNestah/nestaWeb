(1)French Electricity Provider Fined for Storing Users' Passwords with Weak MD5 Algorithm:: The French data protection watchdog on Tuesday fined electricity provider Électricité de France  €600,000 for violating the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.  The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL)  said  the electric utility breached European regulation by storing the passwords for over 25,800 accounts by hashing them using the  MD5 algorithm  as recently as July 2022.  It's worth noting that MD5, a message digest algorithm, is considered cryptographically broken as of December 2008 owing to the risk of  collision attacks .   Furthermore, the authority noted that the passwords associated with 2,414,254 customer accounts had only been hashed and not  salted , exposing the account holders to potential cyber threats.  The probe also pointed fingers at EDF for failing to comply with GDPR data retention policies and for providing "inaccurate information on the origin of the data collected."  "The amount

(2)Australia Passes Bill to Fine Companies up to $50 Million for Data Breaches:: The Australian government has passed a bill that markedly increases the penalty for companies suffering from serious or repeated data breaches.  To that end, the maximum fines have been bumped up from the current AU$2.22 million to AU$50 million, 30% of an entity's adjusted turnover in the relevant period, or three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information, whichever is greater.  The turnover period is the time duration from when the contravention occurred to the end of the month when the incident is officially addressed.   "Significant privacy breaches in recent months have shown existing safeguards are outdated and inadequate," Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus  said  in a statement. "These reforms make clear to companies that the penalty for a major data breach can no longer be regarded as the cost of doing business."  The legislation, called the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Bill 2022, also bestow

(3)3 New Vulnerabilities Affect OT Products from German Companies Festo and CODESYS:: Researchers have disclosed details of three new security vulnerabilities affecting operational technology (OT) products from CODESYS and Festo that could lead to source code tampering and denial-of-service (DoS).  The vulnerabilities, reported by Forescout Vedere Labs, are the latest in a long list of flaws collectively tracked under the name  OT:ICEFALL .  "These issues exemplify either an insecure-by-design approach — which was usual at the time the products were launched – where manufacturers include dangerous functions that can be accessed with no authentication or a subpar implementation of security controls, such as cryptography," the researchers  said .   The most critical of the flaws is  CVE-2022-3270  (CVSS score: 9.8), a critical vulnerability that affects Festo automation controllers using the Festo Generic Multicast (FGMC) protocol to reboot the devices without requiring any authentication and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

(4)Chinese Cyber Espionage Hackers Using USB Devices to Target Entities in Philippines:: A threat actor with a suspected China nexus has been linked to a set of espionage attacks in the Philippines that primarily relies on USB devices as an initial infection vector.  Mandiant, which is part of Google Cloud, is tracking the cluster under its uncategorized moniker  UNC4191 . An analysis of the artifacts used in the intrusions indicates that the campaign dates as far back as September 2021.  "UNC4191 operations have affected a range of public and private sector entities primarily in Southeast Asia and extending to the U.S., Europe, and APJ," researchers Ryan Tomcik, John Wolfram, Tommy Dacanay, and Geoff Ackerman  said .   "However, even when targeted organizations were based in other locations, the specific systems targeted by UNC4191 were also found to be physically located in the Philippines."  The reliance on infected USB drives to propagate the malware is unusual if  not new . The  Raspberry Robin  worm, which has  evolved  into an initial access ser

(5)New Flaw in Acer Laptops Could Let Attackers Disable Secure Boot Protection:: Acer has released a firmware update to address a security vulnerability that could be potentially weaponized to turn off UEFI Secure Boot on affected machines.  Tracked as  CVE-2022-4020 , the high-severity vulnerability affects five different models that consist of Aspire A315-22, A115-21, and A315-22G, and Extensa EX215-21 and EX215-21G.   The PC maker described the vulnerability as an issue that "may allow changes to Secure Boot settings by creating NVRAM variables." Credited with  discovering  the flaw is ESET researcher Martin Smolár, who previously disclosed  similar bugs  in Lenovo computers.  Disabling Secure Boot, an integrity mechanism that guarantees that only trusted software is loaded during system startup, enables a malicious actor to tamper with  boot loaders , leading to severe consequences.  This includes  granting  the attacker complete control over the operating system loading process as well as "disable or bypass protections to silently deploy their

(6)Hackers Using Trending TikTok 'Invisible Challenge' to Spread Malware:: Threat actors are capitalizing on a popular TikTok challenge to trick users into downloading information-stealing malware, according to new research from Checkmarx.  The trend, called  Invisible Challenge , involves applying a filter known as  Invisible Body  that just leaves behind a silhouette of the person's body.  But the fact that individuals filming such videos could be undressed has led to a nefarious scheme wherein the attackers post TikTok videos with links to rogue software dubbed "unfilter" that purport to remove the applied filters.   "Instructions to get the 'unfilter' software deploy  WASP stealer malware  hiding inside malicious Python packages," Checkmarx researcher Guy Nachshon  said  in a Monday analysis.  The WASP stealer (aka W4SP Stealer) is a malware that's designed to steal users' passwords, Discord accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information.

(7)7 Cyber Security Tips for SMBs:: When the headlines focus on breaches of large enterprises like the Optus breach, it's easy for smaller businesses to think they're not a target for hackers. Surely, they're not worth the time or effort?   Unfortunately, when it comes to cyber security, size doesn't matter.   Assuming you're not a target leads to lax security practices in many SMBs who lack the knowledge or expertise to put simple security steps in place. Few small businesses prioritise cybersecurity, and hackers know it. According to Verizon, the number of smaller businesses being hit has climbed steadily in the last few years – 46% of cyber breaches in 2021 impacted businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees.   Cyber security doesn't need to be difficult  Securing any business doesn't need to be complex or come with a hefty price tag. Here are seven simple tips to help the smaller business secure their systems, people and data.  1 — Install anti-virus software everywhere   Every organisation has anti-virus on the

(8)Irish Regulator Fines Facebook $277 Million for Leak of Half a Billion Users' Data:: Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has  levied fines  of €265 million ($277 million) against Meta Platforms for failing to safeguard the personal data of more than half a billion users of its Facebook service, ramping up privacy enforcement against U.S. tech firms.  The fines follow an inquiry initiated by the European regulator on April 14, 2021, close on the heels of a leak of a "collated dataset of Facebook personal data that had been made available on the internet."  This included the  personal information  associated with 533 million users of the social media platform, such as their phone numbers, dates of birth, locations, email addresses, gender, marital status, account creation date, and other profile details.   Meta acknowledged that the information was "old data" that was obtained by malicious actors by taking advantage of a technique called "phone number enumeration" to  scrape users' public profiles . This entailed misusing a t

(9)CISA Warns of Actively Exploited Critical Oracle Fusion Middleware Vulnerability:: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday  added  a critical flaw impacting Oracle Fusion Middleware to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) Catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.  The vulnerability, tracked as  CVE-2021-35587 , carries a CVSS score of 9.8 and impacts Oracle Access Manager (OAM) versions 11.1.2.3.0, 12.2.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.4.0.   Successful exploitation of the remote command execution bug could enable an unauthenticated attacker with network access to completely compromise and take over Access Manager instances.  "It may give the attacker access to OAM server, to create any user with any privileges, or just get code execution in the victim's server," Vietnamese security researcher Nguyen Jang ( Janggggg ), who reported the bug alongside  peterjson ,  noted  earlier this March.   The issue was addressed by Oracle as part of its  Critical Patch Update  in January 2022.   Additional details regarding the natu

(10)Researchers Detail AppSync Cross-Tenant Vulnerability in Amazon Web Services:: Amazon Web Services (AWS) has resolved a cross-tenant vulnerability in its platform that could be weaponized by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources.  The issue relates to a  confused deputy problem , a type of privilege escalation where a program that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action.  The shortcoming was reported by Datadog to AWS on September 1, 2022, following which a patch was shipped on September 6.  "This attack abuses the AppSync service to assume [identity and access management]  roles  in other AWS accounts, which allows an attacker to pivot into a victim organization and access resources in those accounts," Datadog researcher Nick Frichette  said  in a report published last week.   In a coordinated disclosure, Amazon  said  that no customers were affected by the vulnerability and that no customer action is required.  It described it as a "case-sensitivity parsing issue w

(13)Elon Musk Confirms Twitter 2.0 will Bring End-to-End Encryption to Direct Messages:: Twitter chief executive Elon Musk confirmed plans for end-to-end encryption ( E2EE ) for direct messages on the platform.  The  feature  is part of Musk's vision for Twitter 2.0, which is expected to be what's called an "everything app." Other functionalities include longform tweets and payments, according to a slide deck shared by Musk over the weekend.   The company's plans for encrypted messages first came to light in mid-November 2022, when mobile researcher Jane Manchun Wong  spotted  source code changes in Twitter's Android app referencing conversation keys for E2EE chats.  It's worth noting that various other messaging platforms, such as Signal, Threema, WhatsApp, iMessage, Wire, Tox, and Keybase, already support encryption for messages.  Google, which previously turned on E2EE for  one-to-one chats  in its RCS-based Messages app for Android, is currently piloting the same option for group chats.

(14)All You Need to Know About Emotet in 2022:: For 6 months, the infamous Emotet botnet has shown almost no activity, and now it's distributing malicious spam. Let's dive into details and discuss all you need to know about the notorious malware to combat it.  Why is everyone scared of Emotet?  Emotet  is by far one of the most dangerous trojans ever created. The malware became a very destructive program as it grew in scale and sophistication. The victim can be anyone from corporate to private users exposed to spam email campaigns.  The botnet distributes through phishing containing malicious Excel or Word documents. When users open these documents and enable macros, the Emotet DLL downloads and then loads into memory.  It searches for email addresses and steals them for spam campaigns. Moreover, the botnet drops additional payloads, such as Cobalt Strike or other attacks that lead to ransomware.  The polymorphic nature of Emotet, along with the many modules it includes, makes the malware challenging to identify. The Emotet

(16)Russia-based RansomBoggs Ransomware Targeted Several Ukrainian Organizations:: Ukraine has come under a fresh onslaught of ransomware attacks that mirror previous intrusions attributed to the Russia-based Sandworm nation-state group.  Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, which dubbed the new ransomware strain  RansomBoggs , said the attacks against several Ukrainian entities were first detected on November 21, 2022.  "While the malware written in .NET is new, its deployment is similar to previous attacks attributed to Sandworm," the company  said  in a series of tweets Friday.   The development comes as the Sandworm actor, tracked by Microsoft as Iridium, was implicated for a set of attacks aimed at transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland with another ransomware strain called  Prestige  in October 2022.  The RansomBoggs activity is said to employ a PowerShell script to distribute the ransomware, with the former "almost identical" to the one used in the  Industroyer2 malware  attacks that came to light in April.
